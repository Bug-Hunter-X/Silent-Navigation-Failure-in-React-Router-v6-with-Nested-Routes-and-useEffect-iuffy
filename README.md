# Silent Navigation Failure in React Router v6 with Nested Routes and useEffect

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 where navigation to a nested route using `useNavigate` within a `useEffect` hook might fail silently if the parent route's component hasn't fully rendered and accessed its necessary route parameters.

## The Bug
The problem arises when attempting navigation from a parent component to a child route based on parameters received from the parent route's URL. If the `useEffect` hook initiating navigation runs before the parent component fully receives and processes the necessary route parameters, the navigation fails silently.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. Run the application and observe the lack of navigation to the child route.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected version. The solution employs the `useEffect` hook with a dependency array to ensure that navigation only happens after the `parentId` parameter becomes available.

## Additional Notes
This bug showcases a common pitfall when working with asynchronous operations and navigation in React Router. Careful consideration of component lifecycles and data fetching is crucial to prevent such silent failures.
